<h1>
ODIN
</h1>
<h2>
Purpose:
</h2>
<p>
ODIN is a program to backup and restore hard disk partitions. It operates on 
low level and directly reads or writes the blocks of a disk volume. In this
way the complete contents of a drive can be saved to single file. So you 
can for example backup a partition of a Windows installation including all
the installed programs. Be careful: When restoring a backup image to the hard
disk the complete disk contents gets erased. Be sure to select the correct
image file and to choose the correct target partition.
</p>

<p>
An image can only be restored to a partition of exactly the same size as 
the original partition. ODIN will allow you to restore to a bigger partition
but this may result in a corrupt file system. Sometimes you may be able to 
repair this using tools like chkdsk, sometimes it may be unusable.
</p>

<h2>
Usage:
</h2>
<h3><a name="backup">
Backup a partition:
</a></h3>
<p>
Select a volume in the list box and click the Backup radio button on the top.
Select a destination path in the lower box and check that the target volume 
has enough space left to store the complete contents of the source drive. You
may enter a comment in the text box below that allows you later to identify
for which purpose the image was created.
</p>

<h3><a name="restore">
Restore a partition:
</a></h3>
<p>
Select a volume in the list box and click the Restore radio button on the top.
Select a path in the lower box. The volume in the upper box will be the target
volume that the image will be copied to. After changing the keyboard focus the
text box below the image file will display the comment that was created for 
this image. The target volume should have the same size as the original volume
and must not be smaller.
</p>

<h3><a name="verify">
Verify
</a></h3>
<p>
Select a file in the lower list box and click the Verify button on the side.
The verify process will read the complete contents of the image file and 
check that it contains the same contents as at the time the image was created.
If parts of the image file have been manipulated or got modified you will 
receive an error message.
After a backup of a volume you can ensure in this way that the file was written 
accurately. You can perform a verify at any time after the image was written.
</p>

<h3>
Disk and Volume Backups
</h3>
<p>
  If an image of a single volume or a disk with all blocks is created only a single
  file is created with the extension .img. If a disk with only used blocks option is 
  created ODIN will produce a file with an .mbr extension plus a .img file for every
  partition of the disk with the -PartionX.img extension to the provided file name. 
  This set of created files must always be kept together, the .mbr file is not 
  sufficient. The .mbr file contains the master boot record plus the partition 
  information of the disk. You can restore an indvidual partition by selecting a 
  target partition and restore the corresponding .img file from the file set. To 
  restore the complete disk select the .mbr file from the file system and the 
  appopriate disk in the list of available partitions (indicated by label: Entire 
  Disk).
</p>

  <h2><a name="restrictions">
Restrictions:
</a></h2>
<p>
During a backup operation no file activity must be performed on the volume. 
If write operations occur during the backup operation use the Snapshot option
for backup.
Backing up or restoring large images may take several hours of operation.
</p>
<p>
You must have admin privileges to run ODIN. In Windows Vista the user account
control screen will appear after start.
</p>

<h2><a name="aborting">
Aborting a process
</a></h2>
<p>
By pressing the Exit button you can abort any running operation. When aborting
a restore operation the target drive will be in an unusable state so that you 
will need to reformat it before you can use it again.
</p>

<h2><a name="options">
Options
</a></h2>
<p>
When creating a backup image there exist various settings how an image will be created.
</p>

<h3>
Disk Options
</h3>
<p>
You can copy all blocks of a disk volume or only the blocks that are currently in
use by the file system. Used blocks only can only be backuped if the file system
is known, if the volume is mounted and the file system is not corrupted. Normally 
you should only backup used blocks if the option is available. Save all blocks 
for example if you want to make a backup of a damaged file system before trying
repair attempts.
</p>
  <h4>
    Snapshot Function
  </h4>
  <p>
  A snapshot of a volume or disk is a functionality to freeze the current state of
  a medium and make the backup from the snaphshot while the operating system or 
  running applications can still read and write files during the backup. This allows
  for example to backup the Windows system partition while Windows is running. Another
  example might be a database. This functionality requires the VSS (Volume Shadow Copy
  Service) being running. For more details refer to the Microsoft documentation of the
  VSS service. If the VSS is not available this option is greyed out. The VSS is also 
  not available if a 32-Bit application runs under 64-Bit operating system. Using snapshots
  can significantly lower the performance of the backup operation.
  </p>

      <h3>
Compression Options
</h3>
<p>
The blocks that are backuped can be compressed. Compression can save disk space.
The amount of saved space highly depends on the data that are stored on the file
system. If it contains programs (.exe, .dll files) or text and office files the 
compression will be efficient. If the volume contains files that are already
compressed like multimedia files (videos, MP3, JPEGs) you will not benefit from 
a compression of the backup image. You can choose between the gzip and the bzip2
compression algorithm. gzip is faster and bzip2 typically achieves a slightly
better compression ratio.
</p>

<h3>
File Size
</h3>
<p>
You can specify a maximum file size for a backup image. If the backup image 
exceeds the given file size the image file will be split and the file names
are appended with a sequence number. This is useful for example if you later
want to save the files to CDs or DVDs.
